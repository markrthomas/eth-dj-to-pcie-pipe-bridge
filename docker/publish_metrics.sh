#!/usr/bin/env bash
# docker/publish_metrics.sh [RC] — publish this container run's results to the `metrics-data` branch
# of the GitHub repo, so they outlive the (ephemeral) Railway container and can be pulled into the
# dashboard with `make railway-import`.  Called by docker/entrypoint.sh (ci mode) after the run.
#
# Layout on the branch (an orphan branch holding no source):
#   runs/<UTC>-<sha7>/{metrics.db,dashboard.html,run.json}   one directory per run (never rewritten)
#   latest/{...}                                              copy of the newest run
# run.json holds only non-secret run facts (time, commit, Railway service / environment / deployment
# ids from the RAILWAY_* variables Railway injects, exit code).
#
# Needs GITHUB_TOKEN (a fine-grained token limited to THIS repo, Contents: read+write) as a Railway
# service variable.  Without it this prints a notice and exits 0 (results stay in the container).
# The token is passed to git as an http header: it is never put in a URL, a git config file or the log.
# Env: PUBLISH_REPO (owner/name), PUBLISH_BRANCH (default metrics-data), PUBLISH_URL (override, tests).
